        <h2>The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh</h2>
        <p> <b>Professor Muhammad Yunus</b> - Founder Grameen Bank
        Muhammad Yunus
        Inspiration for Grameen Foundation and Founding Member
        of the Board of Trustees
        
       <b>Professor Muhammad Yunus</b> was named the Interim Leader of Bangaldesh on August 8, 2024.  <br>Recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, Professor Yunus is internationally recognized for his work in poverty
        alleviation and the enablement of people living in poverty, especially women. Professor Yunus successfully melded
        capitalism with social responsibility to create the Grameen Bank, a microcredit institution committed to providing small
        amounts of working capital to the poor for entrepreneurship growth.
        
        Inspired by the revolutionary microfinance work of Professor Muhammed Yunus, Grameen Foundation was launched in 1997.
        Professor Yunus' vision of a world free from hunger and poverty is at the root of our mission and we believe the fastest
        way to achieve this goal is by investing in women. <br>
      Today, Grameen Foundation works at the intersection of gender, finance, climate, and technology to change the systems
      that hold women back. We equip women with the tools they need to gain holistic resilience - the ability to adapt to
      shocks and stresses and the capacity to engage in emerging opportunities. <br>
      <br>
    "If you imagine,<br>
    Some day it will happen. <br>
    If you don't imagine, <br>
    It will never happen." <br>
    <br>
    We not only imagine a world free from poverty and hunger, but have a plan to ensure all women and their families can
    permanently exit poverty.
